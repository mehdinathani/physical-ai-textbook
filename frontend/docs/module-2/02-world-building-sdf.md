# World Building with SDF

## Introduction
Simulation Description Format (SDF) is the standard for describing simulation environments in Gazebo. This module covers creating complex worlds for robot simulation and testing.

## Learning Objectives
- Master SDF structure and elements
- Create complex simulation environments
- Design realistic scenes with objects and lighting
- Integrate models and actors into worlds

## SDF Fundamentals
- XML-based format structure
- World, model, and actor elements
- Coordinate systems and transforms
- Version compatibility considerations

## World Elements
- Physics engine configuration
- Gravity settings
- Wind simulation
- Scene lighting and atmosphere

## Model Integration
- Including existing models
- Custom model placement
- Model spawning and configuration
- Model interaction setup

## Scene Design
- Static objects and obstacles
- Dynamic elements and actors
- Terrain and environment modeling
- Multi-room environments

## Lighting and Visual Effects
- Ambient lighting
- Directional and point lights
- Shadows and reflections
- Visual properties

## Advanced Features
- Plugins for custom behavior
- Sensors and actuator models
- Animation and movement
- Scripted scenarios

## Best Practices
- Efficient scene design
- Performance optimization
- Reusable world components
- Documentation and versioning

## Summary
SDF provides powerful capabilities for creating realistic simulation environments for Physical AI testing.
