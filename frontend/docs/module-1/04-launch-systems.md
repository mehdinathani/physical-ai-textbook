# Launch Systems

## Introduction
ROS 2 launch systems provide a powerful way to start and manage multiple nodes simultaneously. This module covers the launch system capabilities and best practices for complex robotic applications.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand ROS 2 launch system architecture
- Create launch files for complex systems
- Manage node parameters and configurations
- Implement conditional launching and event handling

## Launch System Overview
- Python-based launch system
- Launch descriptions and actions
- Composable nodes and components
- Parameter loading and management

## Launch File Structure
- LaunchDescription container
- Node actions
- ExecuteProcess actions
- IncludeLaunchDescription actions

## Advanced Launch Features
- Conditional launch (if/unless conditions)
- Substitutions and variable expansion
- Event handling and callbacks
- Launch arguments and parameters

## Composable Nodes
- Component containers
- Intra-process communication
- Performance benefits
- Configuration management

## Best Practices
- Modular launch file design
- Parameter organization
- Error handling and recovery
- Testing and validation strategies

## Integration with Development Workflows
- Development vs deployment configurations
- Environment-specific parameters
- Multi-robot systems
- Simulation vs real robot launching

## Summary
Launch systems provide essential capabilities for managing complex robotic applications with multiple coordinated nodes.
