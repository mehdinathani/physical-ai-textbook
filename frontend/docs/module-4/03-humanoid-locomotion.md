# Humanoid Locomotion

## Introduction
Humanoid locomotion involves complex control systems that enable bipedal robots to walk, balance, and navigate diverse terrains. This module covers the principles and implementation of humanoid locomotion control.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand bipedal locomotion principles
- Implement balance control systems
- Design walking pattern generators
- Handle dynamic locomotion challenges

## Locomotion Fundamentals
- Center of Mass (CoM) control
- Zero Moment Point (ZMP) theory
- Capture Point dynamics
- Whole-body control approaches

## Walking Pattern Generation
- Preview control methods
- Trajectory optimization
- Footstep planning
- Gait pattern generation

## Balance Control
- Feedback control systems
- Inverted pendulum models
- Linear Inverted Pendulum Mode (LIPM)
- Cart-Table model

## Control Architectures
- Hierarchical control systems
- Task-space vs joint-space control
- Impedance control
- Model Predictive Control (MPC)

## Terrain Adaptation
- Rough terrain navigation
- Step climbing and obstacle crossing
- Slope walking
- Dynamic balance recovery

## Learning-Based Approaches
- Reinforcement learning for locomotion
- Imitation learning from human data
- Neural network controllers
- Adaptive control systems

## Integration with Perception
- Vision-based terrain analysis
- Obstacle detection and avoidance
- Path planning integration
- Multi-sensor fusion

## Summary
Humanoid locomotion combines complex control theory with real-time implementation to achieve stable bipedal walking.
