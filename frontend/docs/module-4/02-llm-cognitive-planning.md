- Implement task decomposition systems
- Handle LLM hallucinations and errors

## LLM Integration Patterns
- Prompt engineering for robotics
- Chain-of-thought reasoning
- Tool usage and function calling
- Memory and context management

## Cognitive Architecture
- Perception-action loop integration
- Long-term memory systems
- Short-term working memory
- Attention and focus mechanisms

## Task Planning
- High-level goal decomposition
- Temporal planning
- Resource allocation
- Constraint satisfaction

## Robot Command Generation
- Natural language to robot commands
- Action sequence generation
- Context-aware command selection
- Safety constraint enforcement

## Integration Challenges
- Handling LLM hallucinations
- Response validation and verification
- Latency considerations
- Reliability and fallback strategies

## Safety and Ethics
- Safe command filtering
- Ethical behavior guidelines
- Privacy considerations
- Bias mitigation

## Evaluation Methods
